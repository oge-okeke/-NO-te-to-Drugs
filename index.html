 This cause and effect model and animation that we created would be targeted to the the uninformed individuals who aren't that educated on the topic as well as those who know someone who is addicted to drugs. The piece is intended to inform the audience of the main causes of addiction and how people are affected by them. In order to get to the main causes, we made claims and asked ourselves "why" to every claim we made on the causes of addiction until we could not ask anymore "why" questions. Our animation comedically shows how that can ruin someone’s life as well as other different factors.

                        <h2>Structure and Narrative!</h2>

        <p>
            The story starts with an animal (a lion) who is addicted to eating red meat and the cheetah notices it. The story escalates when the lion is overly addicted to red meat (symbolizes pills) and his health starts to decline (noticed by the cheetah) The story ends when the antagonist (the addiction) was ended by the cheetah who started stealing the red meat in order to prevent the lion from continuing the addiction.The change would be helping or stopping addictions that are in the world by assisting the people around you. The change would be lifestyle and changing the way that drugs are perceived in the eyes of the addicted. The events of the world would have been changed by the story in a playful and fun way but it still delivers the message. We want our story to evoke a bad feeling that visually tells the viewers that drug addiction is bad. The lion has been sitting around and spending his days eating red meat. The cheetah always notices it and eventually gets around to confronting the lion about it. After he doesn’t listen, the cheetah comes up with a plan to start taking it while he isn't looking and piling it under a tree. The lion insists on the cheetah giving it back, but the lion disagrees. The piles start to become larger and larger which is a sign of a serious addiction. One day the cheetah goes to visit the lion and he is found lying dead with a bunch of red meat lying around. The story ends with the cheetah taking all the meat away as a representation of stopping the addiction. It also ends with a sign that says “this is not about red meat” which is satirical and funny because this seems like a story that had nothing to do with addiction but it needed to be watched in its entirety in order to catch the main idea of the story.

<h2> Code and Explanation! <h2>
    <p> 
This code used in our project was meant to help us create the tone and the mood of our stopmotion video. Essentially, when we click the 2 buttons on the cricket, the colors show up in the exact order that we coded them in. For example, in our stopmotion, we specificlly used the red light duirng times of intensity or seriousness, but in times of calmness and peace we used the blue and white light which significantly made a difference in creating a drastic change in the eyes of the audience.
